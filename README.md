<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

We all know that food delivery systems reward larger orders with cheaper prices. However, when you want to order food, what deters most people from enjoying these savings is the lengthy process of coordinating a food order: finding interested parties, selecting a restaurant everyone is agreeable to, collating orders, calculating final prices after order has closed and discounts have been applied, collecting food orders, updating all parties and distributing food orders accordingly. It’s no wonder that few heroes step up to help us all save a few dollars. 

Thus, we hope to create a solution to that, through an all-in-one food order coordination platform that processes food orders from initiation of a ‘jio’ to the distribution of food. Effortlessly save a few dollars on your favourite restaurant today!
